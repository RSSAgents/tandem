# RS JS/FE Final Project: Tandem - SPA Application

**Tandem** is an interactive platform designed to help developers prepare for technical interviews and practice hard skills (JavaScript, TypeScript, Algorithms) through quizzes and coding challenges.

## 👥 Team - RSSAgents

This project was developed by the RSSAgents team as part of the RS School JS/FE course:

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development and testing.

1.  Install Node.js

2.  Clone the project repository to your local machine

        https://github.com/RSSAgents/tandem.git

3.  Go to folder final-project

        cd tandem

4.  Install all dependencies:

        npm install (npm i)

5.  Create a new branch for your feature development:

        git checkout development
        git pull origin development
        git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name (or fix/your-fix-name)

    ❗❗❗ _Always create feature/fix branches from the `development` branch, not from `main`_.

## 🤝 Team Workflow & Branch Strategy (Development-first)

We follow a Git Flow-inspired model:

- `main` – production-ready releases.
- `development` – integration branch for completed features.
- `feature/*` – new feature branches from `development` branch (e.g., `feature/auth-page`).
- `fix/*` – bug fixes from `development` branch (e.g., `fix/header-bug`)
- `docs/*` – documentation updates only (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `chore/*` – maintenance tasks, no functionality changes (e.g., `chore/package-updates`)
- `ci/*` – CI/CD configaration (e.g., `ci/ci-cd-configaration-fe`)

All changes are merged into `development` via **Pull Requests**, which require at least 3 team members and 1 mentor and passing CI checks. This ensures code review and collective ownership.

❗❗❗ Merging into `main`: Only permitted when the application is release-ready.

❗❗❗ No direct pushes to `development` branch. PR → review → merge (PR can only be merged when all tests pass successfully.)

❗❗❗ Do not delete feature branches after merge — we keep them for history tracking.

## 👆 Commit Requirements

We follow the RS School Conventional Commits specification.

- The commit type MUST BE in lowercase only (init, feat, fix, refactor, docs etc.)
- Present tense ("add feature" not "added feature") should be used.
- Imperative mood ("move cursor to ..." not "moves cursor to ..." should be used).

📚 More information and examples here: https://rs.school/docs/en/git-convention

## 📂 Project Structure

Will be added late (добавлю позже)

## 📈 Task Tracking

- Development progress is managed via [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/RSSAgents/projects/1/views/1).
- Development Diary - https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage2/tasks/rs-tandem/DEVELOPMENT_DIARY.md

## 🚀 Deployment

For deployment, the project will use Vercel.
